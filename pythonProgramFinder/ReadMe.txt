ProgramFinder:
Finds all files in a directory with either .py endings or #!/usr/bin/env in first line.

you need to type the directory path to search from, what you would get when you type "pwd" in terminal.
eg. I type "/home/lewis/mil_ws/src/NaviGator" when I want to search for all python programs in Navigator.
Otherwise you will get zero results
